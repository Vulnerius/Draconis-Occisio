# Draconis occisio

This is my first self-developed indie game made with Unity.

# Task
The task was to create an executable Game for an exam.

# The idea
 
I always wanted to play a magician fighting a boss.
For the wizards abilities there should be flying, some defence and an offensive spell.

# Gameplay

You can move with *WASD* and *Space*.
With *Q* you can cast the shield.
And *E* performs the attack spell.

# Goal

Your goal is to set a High-Score by defeating several dragons in a row.
For this you start with a time buffer of 5 minutes.
You have 3 minutes and 30 seconds to defeat 1 dragon.

If you manage to kill the dragon, the time buffer increases by the fights-remaining time.
If you don't kill the dragon, the time buffer gets decreased by 3 minutes and 30 seconds.

# Defeat

Your High-Score run ends either if you get killed by the dragon or your time buffer runs 0.

## Have fun and create issues if you have improvements
